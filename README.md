# 4-Queen Puzzle Solver

This C++ program solves the classic 4-Queen puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The objective of the puzzle is to place 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)



## Algorithm
The solver implements a simple backtracking algorithm. It recursively tries all possible placements of queens on the board and backtracks whenever it reaches an invalid configuration. The algorithm guarantees finding all possible solutions for the puzzle.

## ADDED THE CHESS BOARD.
just a simple chess board is added.
